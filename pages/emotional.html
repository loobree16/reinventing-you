              <h3>What is Emotional Self-Care?</h3>
              <p>
                Activities that help you connect, process, and reflect on a full
                range of emotions.

              <br />
              <h3>Cultivating Emotional Intelligence</h3>
              <p>
                Emotional intelligence is ‘the ability to sense, understand, and
                effectively apply the power and acumen of emotions as a source
                of human energy, information, and influence.’ - Jack G.
                Montgomery of Western Kentucky University
              </p>
              <p>
                In simpler terms, The more we understand our own emotions, the
                more we see these emotions in others, and then the more we can
                appropriately express our own.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>
                Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, breaks down
                these skills into parts...
              </h4>
              <br />
              <h4>Self-Awareness</h4>
              <p>
                In certain situations, try to notice what you are feeling and
                why. Do you know what you’re good at, and what you’re not?
                Self-awareness means really knowing who you are, and being able
                to examine your own feelings and reactions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Self-Management</h4>
              <p>
                Defined as the awareness and management of how one conducts
                themselves and interacts with the world. It’s your awareness of
                and how you express your emotions.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a strong emotion arises, like anger, one should be able to
                recognize it, analyze its cause, assess its validity, and find
                ways to express it appropriately.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Self-Motivation</h4>
              <p>
                Self-motivation is the force that drives you to do things, to
                work towards your goals, as well as your own self-development.
                When you feel low on self-motivation, ask yourself why? Also,
                ask yourself what the costs to you are if you do not
                self-motivate. The cost could be your self-esteem, disappointing
                your peers, and poor grades or evaluations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your remedy could be many things, like seeing a therapist,
                taking medication, or planning your schedule in advance.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Empathy</h4>
              <p>
                Empathy is also vital to creating emotional intelligence within
                yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Empathy allows you to understand other’s feelings and the
                effects your actions can have on others.

              <h3>Boundaries</h3>
              <p>
                Boundaries are rules or limits that one creates for themselves
                for what is appropriate behavior for the people around them, as
                well as how to respond when someone breaks those rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s important to set personal boundaries for yourself so others
                know what you’re comfortable with and how to treat you.
                Boundaries help you to:
              </p>
              <ol class="e">
                <li>Practice self-care and self-respect.</li>

                <li>Communicate your needs in your relationships.</li>
                <li>Set healthy limits in your relationships.</li>
                <li>
                  Set physical boundaries, which include your body, sense of
                  personal space, and privacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set emotional boundaries, which protects your self-esteem and
                  ability to separate your feelings from others.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                You may feel you cannot enforce boundaries for yourself for many
                reasons. It could be a fear of rejection, confrontation, or
                guilt. You could also have just never been taught healthy
                boundaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re in a situation with someone who is physically
                dangerous or threatening, you should work with a counselor, or
                therapist to help get you to safety, and boundary setting may be
                a part of this.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Self-Compassion</h3>
              <p>
                Self-compassion refers to relating to one’s self with kindness.
              </p>
              <p>
                It means being kind to ourselves in good times and bad, not
                judging yourself harshly for our perceived shortcomings. Many of
                us fall into the trap of self-criticism, which is a
                self-defeating tendency. Self-compassion leads to resilience. It
                involves facing our failures or mistakes in a completely
                different way, with kindness.
              </p>
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Being kind and understandings oneself as one would a friend.
                  We're intrinsically deserving of care and concern just like
                  everybody else.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Understanding we are not alone in our mistakes and weaknesses.
                  It's actually instrinsic to being human, and a normal part of
                  everyone's life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Being mindful of your emotions and feelings without
                  over-identifying with them. Validating our emotions without
                  adding fuel to the fire.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                People who have self-compassion also have greater emotional
                intelligence, social skills, and overall happiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Practice mindfulness, and be aware of your thoughts and
                feelings. More specifically, your inner critic. What is it
                trying to protect you from? Find compassion for these feelings
                and by extension, yourself.

        these emotions. This is essential for our wellbeing.

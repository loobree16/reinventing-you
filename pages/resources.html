            <h4>Permission to Feel</h4>
            <h5>By Marc Brackett Ph.D</h5>

            <h4>Broke Millenial</h4>
            <h5>by Erin Lowry</h5>

            <h4>Nutrition in Crisis</h4>
            <h5>by Richard D. Feinman</h5>
            <p class="rp">
              Biochemist and medical researcher Dr. Richard Feinman explains the
              intricacies of nutrition and human metabolism in plain English.
              The book also offers an unsparing critique of the nutritional
              establishment, which continues to demonize fat and refute the
              benefits of low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets―all despite
              decades of evidence to the contrary.

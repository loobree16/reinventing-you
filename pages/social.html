              <h4>When to stop scrolling</h4>
              <p>
                Check your accounts; know what you want and stop when you don't
                see it.

                  Does the content bring you joy, or any other beneficial

                <li>Does the content add value to your life?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                When you are on social media many times throughout the day and

              <h4>How to absorb content online.</h4>
              <p>
                The digital age has given us access to a wide scope of
                information at our fingertips. With such easy access to so much
                information we have started to have a shorter span of focus due
                to the tendency of going through a plethora of content, which is
                a lot for our brain to absorb and filter. Reading has become
                harder especially on screens that can be harsh on the eyes if
                used for a long time. Staying in one source and fully reading
                and giving your attention to one thing at a time is better than
                “power browsing” and skimming, making you work harder to really
                focus.

              <h3>Communication Tips</h3>
              <h4>Setting Boundaries</h4>
              <p>How communication boundaries work</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In our external system: Boundaries protect our bodies and
                  environment someone breaking your boundaries would be through
                  physical intrusion or line crossing. Ex. someone standing too
                  close to you or snooping through your belongings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In our internal system: Boundaries protect our thoughts,
                  feelings and actions. We can be violated by aggressive tones
                  in voice or slander and demanding behavior towards us.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Weak Boundaries</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  When your boundaries are weak you have low self esteem and you
                  close yourself off to others and have no trust or open
                  communication.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Strong Boundaries</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You have strong relationships when you have strong boundaries.
                  You grow internally and you protect yourself against being
                  violated by others' negative behaviors or negative
                  communication.

        <h4>How to absorb content online.</h4>
        <p>
          The digital age has given us access to a wide scope of information at
          our fingertips. With such easy access to so much information we have
          started to have a shorter span of focus due to the tendency of going
          through a plethora of content, which is a lot for our brain to absorb
          and filter. Reading has become harder especially on screens that can
          be harsh on the eyes if used for a long time. Staying in one source
          and fully reading and giving your attention to one thing at a time is
          better than “power browsing” and skimming, making you work harder to
          really focus.

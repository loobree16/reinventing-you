                  A messy, disorganized home can cost you more than just your

              <h3>Budgeting Tips</h3>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, the word budget has gotten a bad rap. When it all
                boils down, a budget is basically just a plan for your money.
                Budgeting means you’re spending with purpose before the month
                begins. But many people view a budget as a straitjacket that
                will keep them from doing what they want. But that couldn’t be
                further from the truth! A budget doesn’t limit your freedom, it
                gives you freedom! It’s really all about being intentional with
                where your money goes.
              </p>
              <h4>Pick the budgeting method that's right for you.</h4>
              <p>
                Zero-based budgeting is a way of budgeting where your income
                minus your expenses equals zero. With a zero-based budget, you
                have to make sure your expenses match your income during the
                month. That way you’re giving every dollar that’s coming in a
                job to do. Here are the basic steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>1. Write down your monthly income.</li>
                <li>2. Write down your monthly expenses.</li>
                <li>3. Write down your seasonal expenses.</li>
                <li>
                  4. Subtract your income from your expenses to equal zero.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The 50/30/20 rule budget is a simple way to budget that doesn’t
                involve detailed budgeting categories. It only requires you to
                track and divide your expenses into three main categories:
                needs, wants, and savings or debt. This reduces the amount of
                time you have to spend detailing your finances and allows you to
                focus more on the big picture instead.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  50%: Needs, they are those bills that you absolutely must pay
                  and are the things necessary for survival. Half of your
                  after-tax income should be all that you need to cover your
                  needs and obligations. If you are spending more than that on
                  your needs, you will have to either cut down on wants or try
                  to downsize your lifestyle, perhaps to a smaller home or more
                  modest car or cooking at home more often.
                </li>
                <li>
                  30%: Wants, these are all the things you spend money on that
                  are not absolutely essential. This category also includes
                  those upgrade decisions you make, such as choosing a costlier
                  steak instead of a less expensive hamburger, buying a Mercedes
                  instead of a more economical Honda, or spending money to watch
                  cable TV. Basically, wants are all those little extras you
                  spend money on that makes life more enjoyable and
                  entertaining.
                </li>
                <li>
                  20%: Savings, this includes adding money to an emergency fund
                  in a bank savings account, making IRA contributions to a
                  mutual fund account, and investing in the stock market.
                  Savings can also include debt repayment. While minimum
                  payments are part of the "needs" category, any extra payments
                  reduce the principal and future interest owed, so they are
                  savings.
                </li>
              </ol>

          The 50/30/20 rule budget is a simple way to budget that doesn’t
          involve detailed budgeting categories. It only requires you to track
          and divide your expenses into three main categories: needs, wants, and
          savings or debt. This reduces the amount of time you have to spend
          detailing your finances and allows you to focus more on the big
          picture instead.

            50%: Needs, they are those bills that you absolutely must pay and
            are the things necessary for survival. Half of your after-tax income
            should be all that you need to cover your needs and obligations. If
            you are spending more than that on your needs, you will have to
            either cut down on wants or try to downsize your lifestyle, perhaps
            to a smaller home or more modest car or cooking at home more often.
          </li>
          <li>
            30%: Wants, these are all the things you spend money on that are not
            absolutely essential. This category also includes those upgrade
            decisions you make, such as choosing a costlier steak instead of a
            less expensive hamburger, buying a Mercedes instead of a more
            economical Honda, or spending money to watch cable TV. Basically,
            wants are all those little extras you spend money on that makes life
            more enjoyable and entertaining.
          </li>
          <li>
            20%: Savings, this includes adding money to an emergency fund in a
            bank savings account, making IRA contributions to a mutual fund
            account, and investing in the stock market. Savings can also include
            debt repayment. While minimum payments are part of the "needs"
            category, any extra payments reduce the principal and future
            interest owed, so they are savings.
